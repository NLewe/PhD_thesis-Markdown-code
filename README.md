# PhD_thesis-Markdown-code
Markdown scripts for my PhD thesis "The interplay between host plants and priority effects in community assembly processes of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi"

These scripts contain an earlier version of my thesis which can be found here: 
Lewe, Natascha (2023). The interplay between host plants and priority effects in community assembly processes of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Open Access Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington. Thesis. https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.21974357

While the text in the Markdown scripts might be different from that of the final thesis document, the code is 99% up to date. Small differences might be found between code and thesis document, however, if last-minute changes were implemented manually (i.e. labels, etc).

My markdown document might also include comments in German. Most of my coding would not have been possible if not for amazing tutorials and ideas from the web, and I might have copied explanations directly into my scripts. For anyone using code in a publication, please cite their packages appropriately. 
Feel free to contact me if you find copied sentences from your tutorial in my R code and want them removed from my github page. 

Nonetheless, the thesis is the work of the author.

Natascha Lewe, 2023
